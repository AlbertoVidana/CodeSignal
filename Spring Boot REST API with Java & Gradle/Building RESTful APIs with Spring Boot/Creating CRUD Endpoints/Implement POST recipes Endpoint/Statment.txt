our task is to implement a new POST /recipes endpoint in the RecipeController 
class to allow users to add new recipes. Use the save method from 
RecipeRepository to persist the new RecipeItem and return the newly 
added RecipeItem with its generated ID.

After implementing the endpoint, start the server by running 
gradle bootRun and test it using the following cURL command:


Bash
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8080/recipes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Recipe", "description": "This is a new test recipe."}' | python3 -m json.tool

When ready, run the tests by clicking the Run button and proceed to the next task by pressing Submit.
