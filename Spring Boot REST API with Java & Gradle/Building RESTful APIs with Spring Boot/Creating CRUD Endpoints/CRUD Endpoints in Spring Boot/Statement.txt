Welcome to this introductory task on creating CRUD endpoints! 
In this exercise, you'll review how to create, read, update, 
and delete records in a Spring Boot application by utilizing
the provided REST endpoints. The code already contains all 
the required endpoints, so your task is to examine it, start 
the Spring Boot application by running the gradle bootRun 
command, and observe the application's behavior. 
Ensure everything works smoothly. You can use the following 
cURL commands to see these endpoints in action:

Bash
# Get all recipes
curl -sX GET http://localhost:8080/recipes | python3 -m json.tool

# Get a recipe by ID
curl -sX GET http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 | python3 -m json.tool

# Add a new recipe
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8080/recipes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Recipe", "description": "This is a new test recipe."}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Update an existing recipe
curl -sX PUT http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Recipe", "description": "This is an updated test recipe."}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Delete a recipe
curl -sX DELETE http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 | python3 -m json.tool
