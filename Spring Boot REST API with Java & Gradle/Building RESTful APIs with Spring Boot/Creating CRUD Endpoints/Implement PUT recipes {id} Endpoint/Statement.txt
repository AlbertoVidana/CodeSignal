Your task is to implement a new PUT /recipes/{id} endpoint in the RecipeController 
class to allow users to update an existing recipe. Use the findById 
and save methods from RecipeRepository to find the existing 
RecipeItem by its ID, update its details, and persist the changes. 
Return the updated RecipeItem.

After implementing the endpoint, start the server by 
running gradle bootRun and test it using the following cURL command:

Bash
curl -sX PUT http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Pancakes", "description": "Updated fluffy pancakes."}' | python3 -m json.tool

When ready, run the tests by clicking the Run button and 
proceed to the next task by pressing Submit.
