Your task is to implement a new DELETE /recipes/{id} endpoint in the 
RecipeController class to allow users to delete an existing recipe by its ID. 
Use the findById and delete methods from RecipeRepository to find and 
remove the specified RecipeItem.

After implementing the endpoint, start the server by running gradle 
bootRun and test it using the following cURL command:

Bash
curl -sX DELETE http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json"

When ready, run the tests by clicking the Run button and proceed to the next task by pressing Submit.
