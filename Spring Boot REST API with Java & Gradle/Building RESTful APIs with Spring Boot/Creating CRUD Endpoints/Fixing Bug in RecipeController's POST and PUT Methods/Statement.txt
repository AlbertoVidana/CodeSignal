Hey there! It looks like there's a bug in our RecipeController 
class affecting POST and PUT requests. The issue is causing these 
requests not to work as expected. Your task is to diagnose and fix 
the problem. Once you've made the necessary changes, start the 
application by running gradle bootRun and verify that the POST and PUT 
requests are working correctly by using the following cURL commands:

Bash
# Add a new recipe
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8080/recipes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Recipe", "description": "This is a new test recipe."}' | python3 -m json.tool
# Update an existing recipe
curl -sX PUT http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Recipe", "description": "This is an updated test recipe."}' | python3 -m json.tool

Once you're done, feel free to hit the Run button to 
execute tests and the Submit button to proceed to the next task.
