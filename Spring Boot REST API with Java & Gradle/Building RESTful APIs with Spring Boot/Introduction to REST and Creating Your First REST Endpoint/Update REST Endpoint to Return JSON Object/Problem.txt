Great job on your first task! Now, let's proceed to modify our REST Controller.

In this task, you will perform the following steps in the RecipeController:

    Change the URL from /recipe/sandwich to /recipe/american-sandwich.
    Refactor the endpoint to return a Recipe object instead of a string. The Recipe class has already been created for you in src/main/java/com/codesignal/models/Recipe.java and it has one field: instructions. Make sure the Recipe object contains the same instructions: Layer ham and cheese between two slices of bread, add mayo and mustard.

Run the application using gradle bootRun and make a GET request to http://localhost:8080/recipe/american-sandwich using cURL:

Bash

curl http://localhost:8080/recipe/american-sandwich

You should see a JSON response with the sandwich recipe instructions.

Click the Run button to execute the tests, and then press Submit to proceed to the next task.
