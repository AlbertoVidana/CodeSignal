Your task is to modify the DELETE /recipes/{id} endpoint in the RecipeController 
class to return meaningful HTTP status codes using the ResponseEntity class. 
Specifically, this endpoint should return:

    204 No Content if the recipe was successfully deleted.
    404 Not Found if the recipe with the specified ID does not exist.

After implementing the changes, start the server by running 
gradle bootRun and test it using the following cURL commands:

To delete an existing recipe:

Bash
curl -i -sX DELETE http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json"
To attempt to delete a non-existent recipe:
Bash
curl -i -sX DELETE http://localhost:8080/recipes/99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999 -H "Content-Type: application/json"
When ready, run the tests by clicking the Run button and proceed to the next task by pressing Submit.
