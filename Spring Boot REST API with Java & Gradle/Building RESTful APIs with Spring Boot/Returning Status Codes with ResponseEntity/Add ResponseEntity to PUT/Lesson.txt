Your task is to modify the PUT /recipes/{id} endpoint in the RecipeController 
class to use ResponseEntity to return meaningful HTTP status codes. 
If the recipe is successfully updated, return a response with an HTTP 200 
status code along with the updated RecipeItem. If the recipe with 
the given ID is not found, return an HTTP 404 status code.

After implementing the changes, start the server by running gradle 
bootRun and test it using the following cURL commands:

For a successful update:
Bash
curl -i -sX PUT http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Pancakes", "description": "Updated fluffy pancakes."}'

For an unsuccessful update (recipe not found):
Bash
curl -i -sX PUT http://localhost:8080/recipes/99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Non-existent Recipe", "description": "This recipe does not exist."}'

When ready, run the tests by clicking the Run button and proceed to the next task by pressing Submit.
