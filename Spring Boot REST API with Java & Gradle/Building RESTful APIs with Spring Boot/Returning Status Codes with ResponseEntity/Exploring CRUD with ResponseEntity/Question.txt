Let's enhance the CRUD endpoints from the previous unit using 
the ResponseEntity class! Your task is to review all CRUD 
endpoints and take note of the ResponseEntity usage. Start 
the Spring Boot application by running the gradle bootRun 
command and observe the application's behavior to ensure 
everything works smoothly. Use the following cURL commands 
to interact with these endpoints:

Bash

# Get all recipes
curl -i -sX GET http://localhost:8080/recipes

# Get a recipe by ID
curl -i -sX GET http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

# Add a new recip
curl -i -sX POST http://localhost:8080/recipes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Recipe", "description": "This is a new test recipe."}'
# Update an existing recipe

curl -i -sX PUT http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Recipe", "description": "This is an updated test recipe."}'

# Delete a recipe
curl -i -sX DELETE http://localhost:8080/recipes/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

Once you've completed the above steps, click the Run button to execute 
tests and then the Submit button to proceed to the next task.
