Hello! You have developed a simple Spring Boot application that stores recipes. 
The application provides a REST endpoint to fetch a recipe by its ID. 
The application starts normally, but a server error occurs 
when you call the endpoint using the following cURL command:

Bash

curl http://localhost:8080/recipes/1

Your task is to identify the cause of this error and fix it. 
Once you have fixed the error, click the Run button to execute 
tests and Submit to proceed to the next task.

Good luck!
