Great progress so far! In this exercise, your task is to 
extend the provided Spring Boot application by adding a new 
REST endpoint that returns a recipe from a specific 
category: GET /category/{categoryName}/recipes/{recipeId}.

If the recipe is not found, return an IllegalArgumentException.

Here's a cURL command you can use to test your API:

Bash

curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/category/summer-meals/recipes/0 | python3 -m json.tool

Follow the TODO instructions in the RecipeController class to 
complete this task. When ready, click the Run button to execute 
tests and Submit to proceed to the next task.
