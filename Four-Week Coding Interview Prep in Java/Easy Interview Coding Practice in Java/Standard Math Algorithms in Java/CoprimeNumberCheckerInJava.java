/**
 * You are provided with two integers, a and b. Your task is to 
 * write a Java function that checks whether both a and b are 
 * coprime or not. Two numbers are said to be coprime or mutually 
 * prime if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 
 * 1.  * The expected complexity is O(max⁡(a,b))O(max(a,b)​).
 * For example:
 * Java
 * Solution solution = new Solution();
 * System.out.println(solution.areCoprime(15, 28));   // Output: true
 * System.out.println(solution.areCoprime(12, 18));   // Output: false
 * In the first example, the only positive integer that divides both 15 and 28 is 1; hence, they are coprime. However, in the second example, 12 and 18 are divisible by 2 and 3; thus, they are not coprime.
