In this problem, you are given an ArrayList of n integers. 
Additionally, you are given an integer shift, which represents 
the number of positions each element in the list should be moved.

Your task is to create a Java function that should shift every 
element in the list to the right (for a positive shift) 
or to the left (for a negative shift) by shift positions. 
The shift should be circular — the last element should 
be moved to the start of the list if shift is positive, and vice versa.

Please implement this without the usage of any built-in 
methods of Java to shift, sort, or move items in the list. 
Your solution’s efficiency should be O(n)O(n).

Examples:

    For ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and shift = 2, the output should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

    For ls = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and shift = -1, the output should be [2, 3, 4, 5, 1].
